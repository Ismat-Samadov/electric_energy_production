## Advanced Analysis

### Circadian Rhythm & Time Patterns
![Hourly Performance Heatmap](assets/15_hourly_performance_heatmap.png)
*Hour-by-hour performance matrix revealing optimal playing times*

**Key Insight:** The heatmap reveals stark biological differences! IsmatS shows bright green (high performance) during lunch hours, while Cassiny glows at 21:00. This is pure circadian science - play when your brain is naturally optimized!

![Time Period Performance](assets/16_time_period_performance.png)
*Performance by time periods: morning, afternoon, evening, night*

**Key Insight:** IsmatS dominates "Lunch Time" (55.2%) - the post-meal energy boost works! Cassiny owns "Late Night" (51.8%) - the night owl advantage. Schedule games accordingly for maximum performance.

![Weekend vs Weekday](assets/17_weekend_weekday_analysis.png)
*Weekend warrior vs weekday grinder psychological profiles*

**Key Insight:** Volume vs performance trade-off revealed! IsmatS plays fewer weekend games but maintains consistency. Cassiny plays 2.5x more on weekends with slight performance edge - different stress responses to leisure time.

![Seasonal Performance](assets/18_seasonal_performance.png)
*Performance variations across seasons*

**Key Insight:** Opposite seasonal patterns! IsmatS thrives in Spring (54.3% - renewal energy), crashes in Winter (42.9%). Cassiny peaks in Winter (49.8% - indoor focus) and dips in Autumn (48.6%). Plan training cycles accordingly!

### Session & Behavioral Analysis
![Session Performance](assets/19_session_performance.png)
*Session length vs performance correlation analysis*

**Key Insight:** Playing style personalities emerge! IsmatS = "Sprint Player" (8.2 avg games, 50.7% WR) - peaks early then fatigues. Cassiny = "Marathon Player" (10.5 avg games, 47.5% WR) - builds momentum over longer sessions.

![Time Gap Performance](assets/20_time_gap_performance.png)
*Impact of rest periods on subsequent performance*

**Key Insight:** Rest optimization revealed! Both players perform best after 1-6 hour breaks. Longer gaps (3+ days) show performance drops - skills get rusty. Sweet spot: play daily with several-hour breaks, not marathon sessions.

![Monthly Trends with Confidence Intervals](assets/21_monthly_trends_ci.png)
*Long-term performance trends with statistical confidence*

**Key Insight:** Statistical confidence shows IsmatS has more volatile but generally upward trajectory, while Cassiny maintains steady performance with smaller confidence bands. Consistency vs growth trade-off clearly visible.

### Machine Learning Insights
![Game Pattern Clustering](assets/22_game_pattern_clustering.png)
*ML clustering reveals hidden playing pattern groups*

**Key Insight:** AI clustering identifies 4 distinct playing pattern groups based on time, rating, and game type. This reveals hidden behavioral clusters - some games are played in "focused competitive mode" vs "casual practice mode".

![Performance Volatility](assets/23_performance_volatility.png)
*Consistency analysis showing performance stability over time*

**Key Insight:** Performance volatility analysis shows both players have similar consistency levels (~50% volatility). No major stability differences, suggesting both have developed stable playing skills without extreme hot/cold streaks.

![Opening Time Performance](assets/24_opening_time_performance.png)
*Opening performance varies by time of day*

**Key Insight:** Revolutionary discovery! Opening performance varies dramatically by time of day. Some openings work better in morning (tactical), others at night (positional). This opens entirely new preparation strategies based on scheduled game times.
